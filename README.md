What is this program?

Virtual Memory Manager, it from IT365 it uses software to handle the load to accommodate tasks for physical memory shortages. It came from the book "Operating System Concepts with Java - Eighth Edition" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne.

The classes together work to form a virtual memory simulation allowing users to perform address translation for virtual memory addresses and generate the needed statistics about the entire process of address translation.

Why I selected it?

The why I selected the project is more in line with how I feel as a person, memory is a precious thing to me. Both reality and in my computer, I feel having working memory is needed in day to day life. With exploring this project I began to understand more and more what it does. It is a great learning tool to practice with and learn about how memory/address translation works. I feel a bit not creative enough with my own endeavors but this project has made me feel a bit better about exploring myself on coding.

I chose this artifact to better myself as a person as understanding as to how memory works and how I can apply that logic/knowledge for a later job opportunity or even something I can work on or even share with people. As the original code is not mine, I have just altered a large portion of it.

All regards should be given to: "Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne."
